# Algebra

[[toc]]

---

Algebra is a method of written calculations that help us reason about numbers. At the very outset, we should realize that algebra is a skill. And like any skill - driving a car, baking cookies, playing the guitar - it requires (a lot of) practice

The first thing to note is that in algebra we use letters as well as numbers. But the letters represent numbers. We imitate the rules of arithmetic with letters, because we mean that the rule will be true for any numbers.

Here, for example, is the rule for adding fractions:

$$
\frac{a}{b}+\frac{b}{c}=\frac{a + b}{c}
$$

> The numbers are the numerical symbols, while the letters are called literal symbols.

## Algebraic Thinking

Algebraic thinking is a crucial and fundamental element of mathematical thinking and reasoning. It initially involves recognizing patterns and general mathematical relationships among numbers, objects and geometric shapes.

Here is a table that summarizes common words for each operation:

For example, the word product tells us to use multiplication. So, the phrase, "the product of eight and k", can be written as $8k$.

## Algebraic Expressions

An algebraic expression is a mathematical expression that consists of variables, numbers and operations. The value of this expression can change. Algebraic expressions are useful because they represent the value of an expression for all of the values a variable can take on.

**Constants** are a fixed quantity that does not change.

**Quantity** is just another way of saying an amount or a number of something

A **variable** is a symbol that we assign to an unknown value.We use variables when we need to indicate how objects are related even though we may not know the exact values of the objects.

**Coefficients** - The coefficient of a variable is the number that is placed in front (multiplied) of a variable. For example, $3 \times w$ can be written as $3w$ and 3 is the coefficient.

A **factor** is one part of a product. The expression $4+n$ is one factor in the term $11(4+n)$, in the term $8x$ the factor are 8 and $x$.

A **term** can be any of the following:

-   a constant - e.g. $3, 10, π, \frac{1}{2}$
-   the product of a number (coefficient) and a variable: $-3x, 11y, \frac{2}{3}a$
-   the product of two or more variables: $x^2, xy, 2y^2, 7xy$

**Expressions** - An expression is made up of one or more terms: $3w + 4xy + 5$

**Equations** - An equation consists of two expressions separated by an equal sign. The expression on one side of the equal sign has the same value as the expression on the other side: $4+6=5\cdot2$, $l = 3 \cdot w$, $3w + 4xy + 5=2w +3$

**Quadratic Equations** - A Quadratic Equation is an equation of the form:

$$
ax2 + bx + c = 0, \text{where a, b and c are numbers and } a ≠ 0
$$

**Algebraic Fraction** - An algebraic fraction is a fraction that contains an algebraic expression in its numerator and/or denominator. For example: $\frac{4}{2x-3}$

### Multiplication in algebra

The multiplication sign in algebra is a centered dot ($\cdot$). We do not use the multiplication cross $\times$, because we do not want to confuse it with the letter x.

However, we often omit the multiplication dot and simply write $ab$. In other words, **when there is no operation sign between two letters, or between a letter and a number, it always means multiplication**. $2x$ means $2 \cdot x$.

### Division in algebra

In algebra, we use the horizontal division bar (fraction separator).

$$
a = 10 \\
b = 2
$$

$$
\frac{a}{b}= \frac{10}{2}=5
$$

> In algebra we call $a+b$ a **sum** even though we do not name an answer. Similarly, we call $a-b$ a **difference**, $ab$ a **product** and $\frac{a}{b}$ a **quotient**.

### Terms versus factors

When numbers are added or subtracted, they are called **terms**.

When numbers are multiplied, they are called **factors**.

Here is a sum of four terms:

$$
a − b + c − d
$$

> In algebra we speak of a "sum" of terms, even though there are subtractions. In other words, anything that looks like what is above, we call a sum.

Here is a product of four factors:

$$
abcd
$$

The word factor always signifies multiplication. And again, we speak of the "product" $abcd$, even though we do not name an answer.

In the following expression:

$$
2a+4ab+5a(b+c)
$$

there are four terms: $2a$, $4ab$ and $5a(b+c)$. $2a$ has two factors - $2$ and $a$,$4ab$ has three factors - $4$, $a$, $b$, $5a(b+c)$ also has three factors - $5$, $a$ and $(b+c)$. **The parentheses mean that we should treat whatever is enclosed as one number.**

### Writing expressions with variables

Some examples:

-   The sum of -7 and the quantity 8 times x: $-7 + 8x$
-   Take the quantity -3 times x, and then add 1: $-3x + 1$
-   -6 plus the product of -1 and x: $-6+-1x=-6+-x= -6-x$
    -   $-1x$ is the same as $-x$ because 1 times something is always that something.
-   Eight less than the product of seven and x: $7x -8$

### Distributive property with variables

Some examples:

-   $\frac{1}{2}(2a - 6b + 8) = \frac{1}{2}(2a)-\frac{1}{2}(6b)+\frac{1}{2}(8)=a-3b+4=$
-   Apply the distributive property to factor out the GCF: $60m -40$
    -   $60m - 40=20(3m - 2)$

### Like Terms

> The Combining Like Terms process is used to make equations easier to solve.

A term is a constant or a variable in an expression. In the equation $12+3x+2x^2=5x-1$, the terms on the left are $12$, $3x$ and $2x^2$, while the terms on the right are $5x$, and $-1$. Combining Like Terms is a process used to simplify an expression or an equation using addition and subtraction of the coefficients of terms.

Consider the algebraic expression below:

$$
12x + 7 + 5x
$$

$12x$ and $5x$ are like terms. Therefore the coefficients, 12 and 5, can be added. Which results in: $17x + 7$

Some examples of like terms are presented below:

-   The following are like terms because each term consists of a single variable, x, and a numeric coefficient.

$$
2x, 45x, x, 0x, -26x, -x
$$

-   Each of the following are like terms because they are all constants.

$$
15, -2, 27, 9043, 0.6
$$

-   Each of the following are like terms because they are all $y^2$ with a coefficient.

$$
3y^2, y^2, -y^2, 26y^2
$$

For comparison, below are a few examples of unlike terms:

-   The following two terms both have a single variable with an exponent of 1, but the terms are not alike since different variables are used.

$$
17x, 17z
$$

-   Each y variable in the terms below has a different exponent, therefore these are unlike terms.

$$
15y, 19y^2, 31y^5
$$

-   Although both terms below have an x variable, only one term has the y variable, thus these are not like terms either.

$$
19x, 14xy
$$

Things to keep in mind:

-   **Exponents and Bases**: You may have noticed that like terms always have the same base and exponent.
-   **Coefficients**: Also, the coefficient in front of a variable does not change whether or not terms are alike. For instance 3x and 5x and 11x are all like terms. The coefficients ( the '3' in 3x, '5' in 5x and '11' in 11x) do not have anything at all to do with whether or not the terms are like. All that matters is that each of 'x' factors or 'bases' have the same exponent.

Example of combining like terms in an expression:

$$
5x^2 + 7x + 2 - 2x^2 + 7 + x^2
$$

First, we identify sets of like terms. Both 2 and 7 are like terms because they are both constants, and the terms $5x^2$, $-2x^2$, and $x^2$ are like terms because they each consist of a constant times x squared.

Now the coefficients of each set of like terms are added. The coefficients of the first set are the constants themselves, 2 and 7. When added the result is 9. The coefficients of the second set of like terms are 5, -2, and 1. Therefore, when added the result is 4. With the like terms combined, the expression becomes:

$$
9 + 7x + 4x^2
$$
