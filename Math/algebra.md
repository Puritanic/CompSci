Algebra is a method of written calculations that help us reason about numbers. At the very outset, we should realize that algebra is a skill. And like any skill - driving a car, baking cookies, playing the guitar - it requires (a lot of) practice

The first thing to note is that in algebra we use letters as well as numbers. But the letters represent numbers. We imitate the rules of arithmetic with letters, because we mean that the rule will be true for any numbers.

Here, for example, is the rule for adding fractions:

$$
\frac{a}{b}+\frac{b}{c}=\frac{a + b}{c}
$$

> The numbers are the numerical symbols, while the letters are called literal symbols.

## Algebraic Thinking

Algebraic thinking is a crucial and fundamental element of mathematical thinking and reasoning. It initially involves recognizing patterns and general mathematical relationships among numbers, objects and geometric shapes.

Here is a table that summarizes common words for each operation:

![common words for operations](../static/math/operations_common_words.png)

For example, the word product tells us to use multiplication. So, the phrase, "the product of eight and k", can be written as $8k$.

## Algebraic Expressions

An algebraic expression is a mathematical expression that consists of variables, numbers and operations. The value of this expression can change. Algebraic expressions are useful because they represent the value of an expression for all of the values a variable can take on.

**Constants** are a fixed quantity that does not change.

**Quantity** is just another way of saying an amount or a number of something

A **variable** is a symbol that we assign to an unknown value.We use variables when we need to indicate how objects are related even though we may not know the exact values of the objects.

**Coefficients** - The coefficient of a variable is the number that is placed in front (multiplied) of a variable. For example, $3 \times w$ can be written as $3w$ and 3 is the coefficient.

-   If the variable has no visible coefficient, then it has an implied coefficient of 1.
-   If the variable only has a negative sign, then it has an implied coefficient of -1.

A **factor** is one part of a product. The expression $4+n$ is one factor in the term $11(4+n)$, in the term $8x$ the factor are 8 and $x$.

A **term** can be any of the following:

-   a constant - e.g. $3, 10, π, \frac{1}{2}$
-   the product of a number (coefficient) and a variable: $-3x, 11y, \frac{2}{3}a$
-   the product of two or more variables: $x^2, xy, 2y^2, 7xy$

**Expressions** - An expression is made up of one or more terms: $3w + 4xy + 5$

**Equations** - An equation consists of two expressions separated by an equal sign. The expression on one side of the equal sign has the same value as the expression on the other side: $4+6=5\cdot2$, $l = 3 \cdot w$, $3w + 4xy + 5=2w +3$

**Quadratic Equations** - A Quadratic Equation is an equation of the form:

$$
ax2 + bx + c = 0, \text{where a, b and c are numbers and } a ≠ 0
$$

**Algebraic Fraction** - An algebraic fraction is a fraction that contains an algebraic expression in its numerator and/or denominator. For example: $\frac{4}{2x-3}$

### Multiplication in algebra

The multiplication sign in algebra is a centered dot ($\cdot$). We do not use the multiplication cross $\times$, because we do not want to confuse it with the letter x.

However, we often omit the multiplication dot and simply write $ab$. In other words, **when there is no operation sign between two letters, or between a letter and a number, it always means multiplication**. $2x$ means $2 \cdot x$.

### Division in algebra

In algebra, we use the horizontal division bar (fraction separator).

$$
a=10,b=2 \newline
\frac{a}{b}= \frac{10}{2}=5
$$

> In algebra we call $a+b$ a **sum** even though we do not name an answer. Similarly, we call $a-b$ a **difference**, $ab$ a **product** and $\frac{a}{b}$ a **quotient**.

### Terms versus factors

When numbers are added or subtracted, they are called **terms**.

When numbers are multiplied, they are called **factors**.

Here is a sum of four terms:

$$
a − b + c − d
$$

> In algebra we speak of a "sum" of terms, even though there are subtractions. In other words, anything that looks like what is above, we call a sum.

Here is a product of four factors:

$$
abcd
$$

The word factor always signifies multiplication. And again, we speak of the "product" $abcd$, even though we do not name an answer.

In the following expression:

$$
2a+4ab+5a(b+c)
$$

there are four terms: $2a$, $4ab$ and $5a(b+c)$. $2a$ has two factors - $2$ and $a$,$4ab$ has three factors - $4$, $a$, $b$, $5a(b+c)$ also has three factors - $5$, $a$ and $(b+c)$. **The parentheses mean that we should treat whatever is enclosed as one number.**

### Writing expressions with variables

Some examples:

-   The sum of -7 and the quantity 8 times x: $-7 + 8x$
-   Take the quantity -3 times x, and then add 1: $-3x + 1$
-   -6 plus the product of -1 and x: $-6+-1x=-6+-x= -6-x$
-   $-1x$ is the same as $-x$ because 1 times something is always that something.
-   Eight less than the product of seven and x: $7x -8$

### Distributive property with variables

Some examples:

-   $\frac{1}{2}(2a - 6b + 8) = \frac{1}{2}(2a)-\frac{1}{2}(6b)+\frac{1}{2}(8)=a-3b+4=$
-   Apply the distributive property to factor out the GCF: $60m -40$
-   $60m - 40=20(3m - 2)$

### Like Terms

> The Combining Like Terms process is used to make equations easier to solve.

A term is a constant or a variable in an expression. In the equation $12+3x+2x^2=5x-1$, the terms on the left are $12$, $3x$ and $2x^2$, while the terms on the right are $5x$, and $-1$. Combining Like Terms is a process used to simplify an expression or an equation using addition and subtraction of the coefficients of terms.

Consider the algebraic expression below:

$$
12x + 7 + 5x
$$

$12x$ and $5x$ are like terms. Therefore the coefficients, 12 and 5, can be added. Which results in: $17x + 7$

Some examples of like terms are presented below:

-   The following are like terms because each term consists of a single variable, x, and a numeric coefficient.

$$
2x, 45x, x, 0x, -26x, -x
$$

-   Each of the following are like terms because they are all constants.

$$
15, -2, 27, 9043, 0.6
$$

-   Each of the following are like terms because they are all $y^2$ with a coefficient.

$$
3y^2, y^2, -y^2, 26y^2
$$

For comparison, below are a few examples of unlike terms:

-   The following two terms both have a single variable with an exponent of 1, but the terms are not alike since different variables are used.

$$
17x, 17z
$$

-   Each y variable in the terms below has a different exponent, therefore these are unlike terms.

$$
15y, 19y^2, 31y^5
$$

-   Although both terms below have an x variable, only one term has the y variable, thus these are not like terms either.

$$
19x, 14xy
$$

Things to keep in mind:

-   **Exponents and Bases**: You may have noticed that like terms always have the same base and exponent.
-   **Coefficients**: Also, the coefficient in front of a variable does not change whether or not terms are alike. For instance 3x and 5x and 11x are all like terms. The coefficients ( the '3' in 3x, '5' in 5x and '11' in 11x) do not have anything at all to do with whether or not the terms are like. All that matters is that each of 'x' factors or 'bases' have the same exponent.

Example of combining like terms in an expression:

$$
5x^2 + 7x + 2 - 2x^2 + 7 + x^2
$$

First, we identify sets of like terms. Both 2 and 7 are like terms because they are both constants, and the terms $5x^2$, $-2x^2$, and $x^2$ are like terms because they each consist of a constant times x squared.

Now the coefficients of each set of like terms are added. The coefficients of the first set are the constants themselves, 2 and 7. When added the result is 9. The coefficients of the second set of like terms are 5, -2, and 1. Therefore, when added the result is 4. With the like terms combined, the expression becomes:

$$
9 + 7x + 4x^2
$$

## Equations

Whenever we have an equation with a variable, we call it an algebraic equation, for example:

$$
x + 2 = 6
$$

### Solving Equations

When working with equations, it's best to pretend that we have a hypothetical scale. For example, to solve $x+23=45$, we can say that on the right side there are 45 pennies and on the left side are 23 pennies and an unknown amount of pennies. The scale is balanced, therefore, we know that there must be an equal amount of weight on each side.

As long as the same operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc.) is done to both sides of the scale, it will remain balanced. To find the unknown amount of pennies of the left side, remove 23 pennies from each side of the scale. **This action keeps the scale balanced and isolates the unknown amount.** Since the weight(amount of pennies) on both sides of the scale are still equal and the unknown amount is alone, we now know that the unknown amount of pennies on the left side is the same as the remaining amount (22 pennies) on the right side.

Because an equation represents a scale, it can also be manipulated like one. Below is a simple equation and the steps to solving it:

-   Initial problem: $x+23=45$
-   Subtract 23 from each side: $x + 23 - 23	=45 - 23$
-   Result: $x=22$

Now, a more complex equation. This equation has both a constant and a variable on each side. Again, to solve this we must keep both sides of the equation equal; perform the same operation on each side to get the variable "x" alone. The steps to solving the equation are shown below:

-   Initial problem: $x + 23=2x + 45$
-   Subtract x from each side: $x - x + 23	=2x - x + 45$
-   Result: $23	=x + 45$
-   Now, subtract 45 from each side: $23 - 45=2x + 45 - 45$
-   Result: $-22=2x$
-   Switch the left and right sides of the equation: $2x =-22$
-   This means that the unknown number multiplied by two, equals -22. To find the value of x, we can use the process "dividing by the coefficient":
-   Since we determined that the coefficient of x is 2, we divide each side of the equation by 2:
-   After dividing by 2: $1x	=-11$
-   Finally rewritten as $x	=-11$

More examples:

-   $a-5=-2 \newline a+5=-2+5 \newline a=3$
-   $a+5=54 \newline a-5=54-5 \newline a=49$

Based on this _balance beam model_, we know that we always have to do the same thing to both sides of an equation to keep it true. But how do we know what to do to both sides of the equation?

-   **Addition and subtraction are inverse operations:**

    -   Inverse operations are opposite operations that undo or counteract each other. Here's an example of how subtraction is the inverse operation of addition: $7+3−3=7$, an example of how addition is the inverse operation of subtraction: $5−2+2=5$.

-   **Multiplication and division are inverse operations:**
    -   Here's an example of how division is the inverse operation of multiplication: $7 \cdot 3 \div 3 = 7$, and here's an example of how multiplication is the inverse operation of division: $8 \div 4 \cdot 4=8$.

#### Solving an addition equation using inverse operations

Let's think about how we can solve for k in the following equation:

$$
k + 22 = 29
$$

We want to get k by itself on the left hand side of the equation. So, what can we do to undo adding 22?

We can subtract 22 because the inverse operation of addition is subtraction!

$$
\begin{aligned}
&k + 22 = 29 \\
&k + 22 - 22 = 29 - 22 \hspace{4.5em}\text{\{Subtract 22 from each side\}}\\
&k=7\hspace{11.7em}\text{\{Simplify\}}
\end{aligned}
$$

#### Solving a subtraction equation using inverse operations

Now let's try to solve a slightly different type of equation:

$$
p−18=3
$$

We want to get p by itself on the left hand side of the equation. So, what can we do to cancel out subtracting 18?

We can add 18 because the inverse operation of subtraction is addition!

$$
\begin{alignedat}{2}
&p−18=3 \\
&p- 18 + 18=3+18 \hspace{1em}&\text{\{Add 18 to each side.\}} \\
&p=21 &\text{\{Simplify\}}
\end{alignedat}
$$

#### Solving a multiplication equation using inverse operations

Let's think about how we can solve for t in the following equation: $6t=54$

We want to get t by itself on the left hand side of the equation. So, what can we do to undo multiplying by 6?

We should divide by 6 because the inverse operation of multiplication is division!

$$
\begin{alignedat}{2}
&6t=54 \\
&\frac{6t}{6}=\frac{54}{6} \hspace{1em}&\text{\{Divide each side by six\}}\\
&t=9 &\text{\{Simplify\}}
\end{alignedat}
$$

#### Solving a division equation using inverse operations

Now, let's try to solve a slightly different type of equation: $\frac{x}{5}=7$

We want to get x by itself on the left hand side of the equation. So, what can we do to cancel out dividing by 5?

We can multiply by 5 because the inverse operation of division is multiplication!

$$
\begin{alignedat}{2}
&\frac{x}{5}=7 \\
&\frac{x}{5} \cdot 5 = 7 \cdot 5 \hspace{1em}&\text{\{Multiply each side by five\}} \\
&x=35
\end{alignedat}
$$

	&\frac{1}{3}+a=\frac{5}{3} \\
	&\frac{1}{3}-\frac{1}{3} +a = \frac{5}{3}-\frac{1}{3} \\

$$

$$

	&\frac{5}{13}=t-\frac{6}{13}\\
	&\frac{6}{13}+\frac{5}{13}=t \hspace{4.5em} \text{\{-6/13 and +6/13 cancel each other\}}\\

	&c=\frac{0.6}{1.2}\hspace{4.5em} \text{\{Multiply by 10 to get rid of the decimal points\}}\\
	&c=\frac{6}{12}\\
	&c=\frac{1}{2}
\end{aligned}
\tag{5}
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
	&\frac{1}{4}=\frac{y}{12}\\
	&12 \cdot\frac{1}{4}=\cancel{12}\cdot\frac{y}{\cancel{12}}\\
	&\frac{12}{4}=y\\
	&3=y
\end{aligned}
\tag{6}
$$

## Inequalities

> Inequalities show the relation between two expressions that are not equal.

Equations and inequalities are both mathematical sentences formed by relating two expressions to each other. In an equation, the two expressions are deemed equal which is shown by the symbol = as in $x=y$.

In an inequality, the two expressions are not necessarily equal which is indicated by the symbols: >, <, ≤ or ≥, as in $x > y$ or $x \geq y$

An equation or an inequality that contains at least one variable is called an **open sentence**. When you substitute a number for the variable in an open sentence, the resulting statement is either true or false. If the statement is true, the number is a solution to the equation or inequality.

### Solving Inequalities

As with equations, when we add or subtract the same number on both sides of the truth of the inequality doesn't change.

This holds true for all numbers:

-   $x\gt y\rarr x\lt y\rarr$
-   $x+z\gt y+z\rarr x+z\lt y+z\rarr$
-   $x−z\gt y−zx−z\lt y−z$

Example:

-   $x+3\gt9$
-   $x+3−3\gt9−3$
-   $x\gt6$

---

It is a little bit trickier when it comes to division and multiplication. When we multiply or divide an inequality by a positive integer, the truth of the inequality doesn't change:

-   $x\gt y\rarr$
-   $x⋅z\gt y⋅z\rarr$
-   $\frac{x}{z} \gt \frac{y}{z}$
-   $If \hspace{0.1em}z \gt 0$

But, **when we multiply or divide an inequality by a negative integer, the sign of the inequality will be reversed (changed)**:

-   $x\gt y\rarr$
-   $x⋅z\lt y⋅z\rarr$
-   $\frac{x}{z} \lt \frac{y}{z}$
-   $If \hspace{0.1em}z \lt 0$

Example:

-   $\frac{x}{-2} \geq 3$
-   $\frac{x}{-2}\cdot -2 \geq 3 \cdot -2$
-   $x \leq -6$
-   Solve $2-3x \lt 14$:
    -   We can treat this just like a normal algebra equation, but we need to keep in mind that when we multiply or divide by a negative number we need to flip around $\lt$ to $\gt$, the inequality has to change a sign.
    -   We can start by subtracting 2 from both sides, which results in: $-3x \lt 12$
    -   At this point we're going to divide by the negative 3, but we need to be very careful, because when we're dividing or multiplying by a negative number, inequality changes sign: $\frac{\cancel{-3}x}{\cancel{-3}}\lt \frac{12}{-3}=x \gt -4$
-   Solve $x+2 \leq 2x$:
    -   $x+2 \leq 2x=x+2-2 \leq 2x -2 = x \leq x$
-   Solve $3x +4 \gt 5x$:
    -   $3x +4 -4 \gt 5x -4 = 3x \gt 1x$

## Dependent and independent variables

On a graph, the dependent variable is typically plotted on the _y-axis_ and the independent variable is plotted on the _x-axis_.

Example:

-   $y=2x$

In the function above, $y$ is the dependent variable, and $x$ is the independent variable. If the value of $x$ is said to be 1 (input), then the value of $y$ will be 2 (output).

### Independent variable

> An independent variable is not influenced by another variable. They are sometimes called the “argument” of the function.

An **independent** variable is a variable that represents a quantity that is being manipulated in an experiment. $x$ is often the variable used to represent the independent variable in an equation.

Example:

You are doing chores to earn your allowance. For each chore you do, you earn \$3. The independent variable here is the amount of chores you do because this is the variable you have control over.

### Dependent variables

> A dependent variable is determined by another variable. They are dependent on the “input” value. Dependent variables represent the “output” value of a function, and they are sometimes called the “value” of the function.

A **dependent** variable represents a quantity whose value depends on how the independent variable is manipulated. $y$ is often the variable used to represent the dependent variable in an equation.

The dependent variable in above example is the amount of money you earn because the amount of money you earn depends on how many chores you do.
