## Data

> Data is a collection of facts, such as numbers, words, measurements, observations or even just descriptions of things.

Data can be qualitative or quantitative.

![Data types](../static/math/data-types.svg)

-   **Qualitative** data is descriptive information (it describes something)
-   **Quantitative** data is numerical information (numbers)

Quantitative data can be Discrete or Continuous:

-   **Discrete data** can only take certain values (like whole numbers)
-   **Continuous data** can take any value (within a range)

> Put simply: Discrete data is counted, Continuous data is measured

### How to Show Data

-   Pie Charts
-   Dot Plots
-   Line Graphs
-   Scatter (x,y) Plots
-   Pictographs
-   Histograms
-   Frequency Distribution and Grouped Frequency Distribution
-   Stem and Leaf Plots
