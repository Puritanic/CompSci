## Properties of numbers

Properties are like a set of math rules that are always true. They often help us solve equations.

The commutative properties only work with addition and multiplication; they do not work with subtraction and division!

The associative properties only work with addition and multiplication; they do not work with subtraction and division!

### Properties of addition

There are three main properties of addition:

-   **Commutative property of addition**: Changing the order of addends does not change the sum. For example, $4 + 2 = 2 + 4$.
-   **Associative property of addition**: Changing the grouping of addends does not change the sum. For example: $(2+3)+4=2+(3+4)$
-   **Identity property of addition**: The sum of 0 and any number is that number. For example $0+4=4$
    -   Above is true because the definition of 0 is _no quantity_, so when we add 0 to 4, the quantity of 4 doesn't change!

### Properties of Multiplication

There are three main properties of multiplication:

-   **Commutative property of multiplication**: Changing the order of factors does not change the product. For example: $4\times3=3\times4$
-   **Associative property of multiplication**: Changing the grouping of factors does not change the product. For example: $(2\times3)\times4=2\times(3\times4)$
    -   > Just keep in mind that parentheses have a priority
-   **Identity property of multiplication**: The product of 1 and any number is that number. For example: $7\times1=7$
-   **Distributive property of multiplication over addition**: $a(b + c) = ab + ac$. It says that adding two numbers inside parentheses, then multiplying that sum by a number outside the parentheses is equal to first multiplying the number outside the parentheses by each of the numbers inside the parentheses and then adding the two products together. Example: $2(4+6) = 2\cdot4+2\cdot6$
-   **Distributive property of multiplication over subtraction**: $a(b - c) = ab - ac$. It says that subtracting two numbers inside parentheses, then multiplying that difference times a number outside the parentheses is equal to first multiplying the number outside the parentheses by each of the numbers inside the parentheses and then subtracting the two products. Example: $9(5 - 3) = 9(5) - 9(3)$

### Factoring

_Factoring_ is the reverse of the distributive property. Instead of getting rid of parentheses, factoring allows us to include parentheses (because sometimes it’s simpler to work with an expression that has parentheses).

Examples:

Factor $15y + 12$:

$$
15y +12 = 3(5y +4)
$$

Factor $12a + 18$:

The GCF of 12 and 18 is 6. So, we divide all terms by 6 and put it outside of the parentheses.

$$
12a+18 = 6(2a+3)
$$

## Whole numbers & integers

**Whole numbers** are the numbers starting at 0 and counting up infinitely:

$$
{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,\dots}
$$

> Whole numbers don't include negative numbers, fractions, or decimals.

**Integers** are just like whole numbers, but they also include negative numbers:

$$
{\dots, -5,-4,-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,\dots}
$$

> Like whole numbers, integers don't include fractions or decimals.

## Divisibility Rules

Some divisibility rules can help you find the factors of a number. If a number is even, it's divisible by 2, i.e., 2 is a factor. If a number's digits total a number that's divisible by 3, the number itself is divisible by 3, i.e., 3 is a factor. If a number ends with a 0 or a 5, it's divisible by 5, i.e., 5 is a factor.

If a number is divisible twice by 2, it's divisible by 4, i.e., 4 is a factor. If a number is divisible by 2 and by 3, it's divisible by 6, i.e., 6 is a factor. If a number is divisible twice by 3 (or if the sum of the digits is divisible by 9), then it's divisible by 9, i.e., 9 is a factor.

To test if something is **divisible by 2**, you just need to look at the ones place and see if it's even number/divisible by 2.

To test if something is **divisible by 3**, you have to add up all the digits inside the number and see if the sum is divisible by 3.

To test if something is **divisible by 4**, you can look up the last two digits of the numbers and see if those are divisible by 4. If it's an odd number and not divisible by 2 number is also not divisible by 4.

To test if something is **divisible by 5**, you can look up if your final digit is equal to 5 or 0.

To test if something is **divisible by 6**, it must be divisible both by 2 and 3 to be divisible by 6.

To test if the number is **divisible by 8**, you only must check to see whether the last three digits of the number are divisible by 8. If they are, then the entire number is divisible by 8 too.

To test if the number is **divisible by 7**, you can use a weird trick: you must take the last digit of the number you’re testing and double it. Then, subtract this number from the rest of the remaining digits. If this new number is either 0 or if it’s a number that’s divisible by 7, then then the original number is divisible by seven. (You may have to repeat this a couple of times if the divisibility of the resulting number is not immediately obvious).

_Example 1_: Is the number 364 divisible by 7? Answer 1: Yes: Double the 4 to get 8. Subtract 8 from 36 to get 28. Since 28 is divisible by 7, we can now say for certain that 364 is also divisible by 7.

_Example 2_: Is the number 8256 divisible by 7? Answer 2: No, Double 6 to get 12. Subtract 12 from 825 to get 813. 813 is slightly too large to tell whether it is divisible by 7, so we must repeat the process. Double 3 to get 6. Subtract 6 from 81 to get 75. Since 75 is not divisible by 7, neither is 813 or 8256. Therefore, 8256 is not divisible by 7.

To test if something is **divisible by 9**, you have to add up all the digits inside number and see if the sum is divisible by 9. _(Similar to division test for 3)_

To test if something is **divisible by 10**, you just have to check if the number last two digits of the number are divisible by 10, or if you have a zero in the ones place.

## Factors

Factors are integers you multiply together to get another integer. Every number greater than 1 has at least two factors, because every number can be divided by 1 and itself! A **factor** is a whole number that can divide evenly into another number. The factors of 8 are 1, 2, 3, and 4 because all of them divide evenly into 8. A factor pair is 2 whole numbers that can be multiplied to get a certain product. The factor pairs of 8 are 1 and 8, because $1 \times 8 = 8$, and 2 and 4, because $2 \times 4 = 8$.

### Finding factors of a number

The quickest way to find the factors of a number is to divide it by the smallest prime number (bigger than 1) that goes into it evenly with no remainder. Continue this process with each number you get, until you reach 1.

### Factor with the distributive property

Another wy to factor numerical expressions is by applying distributive property:

Example:

Apply the distributive property to factor out the greatest common factor:

$$
35 + 50 = 5 \times 7 + 5 \times 10= \underline{5}(7 + 10)
$$

$$
75 + 20 = 5 \times 15 + 5 \times 4 = \underline{5}(15 + 4)
$$

### Finding Factors Quickly

Establish the number you want to find the factors of, for example, 24. Find two more numbers that multiply to make 24. In this case, `1 x 24 = 2 x 12 = 3 x 8 = 4 x 6 = 24`. This means the factors of 24 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24.

Factor negative numbers in the same way as positive numbers, but make sure the factors multiply together to produce a negative number. For example, the factors of -30 are -1, 1, -2, 2, -3, 3, -5, 5, -6, 6, -10, 10, -15 and 15.

### Greatest common factor (GCF)

The greatest common factor, or GCF, is the greatest factor that divides two numbers, or to simplify, it's the biggest number that divides evenly into each number in a given set of numbers.

To find the GCF of two numbers:

1. List the prime factors of each number. (Prime factorization)
2. Multiply those factors both numbers have in common. If there are no common prime factors, the GCF is 1.

Some examples:

-   Find the GCF of 18 and 24:
    -   $18 = 2 \times 3 \times 3, \ \ \ 24=2\times2\times2\times3$
    -   There is one pair of $2$ and one pair of $3$ in common, so the GCF is: $2\times 3=6$
-   Find the GCF of 60 and 60:
    -   > In general, the greatest common factor of any number and itself is that number.
    -   $60=2\times2\times3\times5, \ \ \ 60=2\times2\times3\times5$
    -   the factors that are common to each number are the same, so the GCF is $60$
-   Find the GCF of 18 and 21:
    -   $18 = 2 \times 3 \times 3 ,\ \ \ 24=3\times7$
    -   we have only one pair of $3$ in common, so the GCF is $3$.
-   Find the GCF of 288 and 128
    -   $288 = 2\times2\times2\times2\times2\times3\times3, 128=2\times2\times2\times2\times2\times2\times2$
    -   GCF is $2\times2\times2\times2\times2 = 32$, because we have 5 pairs of $2$ in common.

## Multiplies

A **multiple** is a number that results when we multiply one whole number by another whole number. The first four multiples of 3 are 3, 6, 9, and 12. We can never list all of the multiples of a number. Identifying multiples: We can check to see if a number is a multiple of another number by seeing if it can be divided evenly by the number. 15 is a multiple of 3 because $15 \div 3 = 5$

$$
factor ~ \times ~ factor = multiple
$$

Given $9 \times 2 = 18$ we can say that:

-   9 and 2 are factors of 18
-   18 is a multiple of 2

> Every number has an infinite list of multiples.

### Least common multiple (LCM)

A common multiple is a number that is a multiple of two or more numbers. The common multiples of 3 and 4 are $0, 12, 24, ...$ The least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers is the smallest number (not zero) that is a multiple of both, so LCM of 3 and 4 is 12.

To find a $lcm(30,45)$, without listing out all of their multiplies we can do this:

-   factor 30 and 45 to prime numbers, so that we get:
    -   30 = 2 × 3 × 5
    -   45 = 3 × 3 × 5
-   Then multiply each factor the greatest number of times it occurs in either number. If the same factor occurs more than once in both numbers, you multiply the factor the greatest number of times it occurs:
    -   2: one occurrence
    -   3: two occurrences
    -   5: one occurrence
    -   2 × 3 × 3 × 5 = 90 <— LCM
-   After you've calculated the least common multiple, always check to be sure your answer can be divided evenly by both numbers.

Some examples:

-   $lcm(6,16)$
    -   $\text{multiplies of 6 are:}6,12,18,24,30,36,42,48,54,60...\\\text{multiplies of 16 are:}16,32,48,64,80...$
    -   We can see above that the least common multiple for 6 and 16 is 48

> The GCF or LCM cannot be negative.

## Prime Numbers

A number that can only be divided by 1 and itself is called a prime number. Examples of prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13. The number 1 is not considered a prime number because 1 goes into everything.

> We know that 3x2x5 = 30. So 2, 3, and 5 are factors of 30. 30 is a multiple of each of 3, 2, and 5. If a number only has itself and 1 as factors, then the number is _prime_. 2 IS ALSO THE ONLY EVEN PRIME NUMBER.

### Prime factorization

_Example:_ Find the least common multiples of numbers 6 and 8:

Break apart numbers to its prime numbers:

```js
    6         8
  /   \     /   \
 2     3   2     4
                / \
               2   2
```

To find the least common multiple, we need to multiply at least three 2 with one 3. We have 4 twos here, but both 6 and 8 have 2, so those cancel each other. So:

$$ 2 \times 3 \times 2 \times 2 = 24 $$

24 is the least common multiple of the 6 and 8.

## Scientific notation

**Scientific notation** is a shorthand way of writing numbers that are often very small or large by using powers of 10.

$$
2.3 \times 10^6 = 2300000
$$

In scientific notation, the first number is greater than or equal to 1, but less than 10. The second number is a power of 10.

-   Very large number: $7.4 x 10^9 = 7400000000$
-   Very small number: $7.4x10^{-9} =0.0000000074$

To convert a number from scientific notation to standard notation:

-   If the exponent on the 10 is positive, move the decimal that many spaces to the right.
-   If the exponent on the 10 is negative, move the decimal that many spaces to the left

-

Examples:

Convert $8.91 x 10^7$ to standard notation:

The exponent 7 is positive, so move the decimal seven spaces to the right (and fill with zeros).

$$
8.91 \times 10^7 = 89100000
$$

Convert $4.667 \times 10^{-6}$ to standard notation.

The exponent 6 is negative, so move the decimal six spaces to the left (and fill with zeros).

$$
4.667 \times 10^{-6} = 0.000004667
$$

### Calculating Numbers in Scientific Notation

To multiply numbers in scientific notation just write the base once and add the exponents.

$$
\begin{aligned}
	&(2 x 10^4) (3 x 10^5) \\
	&=2\cdot10^4 \cdot3\cdot10^5 \\
	&\text{[Keep the base 10 and add the exponents:] } 10^{4+5} = 10^9 \\
	&=2x3x10^9 \\
	&=6x10^9
\end{aligned}
$$

To divide numbers in scientific notation, just write the base once and subtract the exponents.

$$
\begin{aligned}
	&\frac{8 \cdot 10^9}{4 \cdot 10^6} \\
	&= \frac{8}{4}\cdot \frac{10^9}{10^6} \\
	&\text{[Keep the base 10 and subtract the exponents:] } 10^{9-6} = 10^3 \\
	& 2 \cdot 10^3
\end{aligned}
$$
