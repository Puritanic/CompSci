## Absolute values

Opossite of an number is the number that is same distance from the zero, but on the other side of it.

For example:
opossite of 3 is -3, of the 5 is -5, 72 is -72 and so on...

One way to think about it is that the number will have the same absolute value but the different sign.

Example:

Find |x| when $x = 5$, $x = -10$ and $x = -12$.

> |x| (pipes) are the notation for the absolute values.

$$
|5| = 5, |-10| = 10, |-12| = 12
$$

> This is just a distance from the zero.

### Calculating value as distance between the numbers

<----a------b---->

<----b------a---->

$$ |a-b| = |b-a| $$
or:

$$
|-2-3| = |-5| = 5
$$

$$
|3-(-2)| = | 5 | = 5
$$

## Negative numbers addition

$$
15 + (-46) + 29 = -2
$$

$$
-15-46-29 = -90
$$

## Multiplying negative numbers

> Myltiplying negative with negative always yields a positive value
> Myltiplying negative with positive always yields a negative number
