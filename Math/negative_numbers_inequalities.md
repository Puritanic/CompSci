## Negative Numbers

### Absolute values

Opposite of an number is the number that is same distance from the zero, but on the other side of it.

For example: opposite of 3 is -3, of the 5 is -5, 72 is -72 and so on...

One way to think about it is that the number will have the same absolute value but the different sign.

Example:

Find |x| when $x = 5$, $x = -10$ and $x = -12$.

> |x| (pipes) are the notation for the absolute values. Absolute value bars are also grouping symbols, so you must complete the operation inside them first, then take the absolute value.

$$
|5| = 5, |-10| = 10, |-12| = 12
$$

> The **absolute value** is just the number's distance from the zero.

$$
|5| = 5\enspace abs\enspace of\enspace 5\enspace is\enspace 5.
$$

$$
|-10| = 10\enspace abs\enspace of\enspace -10\enspace is\enspace 10.
$$

#### Calculating value as the distance between the numbers

<----a------b---->

<----b------a---->

$|a-b| = |b-a|$ or:

$$
|-2-3| = |-5| = 5
$$

$$
|3-(-2)| = | 5 | = 5
$$

### Negative numbers addition

$$
15 + (-46) + 29 = -2
$$

$$
-15-46-29 = -90
$$

$$
6 + (-3) = 3 \\
\text{we could write this as:} \\
(+6)+(-3)=(+3)
$$

> In other words subtracting a positive is the same as adding a negative.

### Multiplying negative numbers

-   Multiplying negative with negative always yields a positive value.
-   Multiplying negative with positive always yields a negative number.
-   If there are an odd number of negative numbers, the result is NEGATIVE.
-   If there are an even number of negative numbers, the result is POSITIVE.

## Inequalities

An inequality is a mathematical sentence that is used to compare quantities and contains one of the following signs: $\lt, \gt, \not=, \leq, \geq$.

> Just like when we add or subtract fractions with different denominators, we have to make the denominators the same when comparing fractions.
