## Ratio

> The numbers or measurements being compared are called the terms of the ratio.

The ratio is the relationship of two numbers. For example you have 2 flashlights and 5 batteries. To compare the ratio between the flashlights and the batteries we divide the set of flashlights with the set of batteries.

The ratio is 2 to 5 or 2:5 or 2/5. All these describe the ratio in different forms of fractions. The ratio can consequently be expressed as fractions or as a decimal. 2:5 in decimals is 0.4.

> Order matters in ratios!

_Some Examples:_

-   Thea has 6 pieces of granite, 21 pieces of marble, 12 pieces of sandstone, and 11 piece of slate. _What is the ratio of pieces of sandstone to pieces of marble in Thea's collection?_ Answer: **12:21**

We can simplify the answer further, as both numbers are divisible by 3, thus simplified answer would be **4:7**, or ,in words, four for every seven.

-   If 5 kgs of avocados cost 9 dollars, what is the cost for 1 kg of avocados? - So, the ratio here is $5:9$, and to calculate how much one kg costs we can simplify this: $\\5:9=1:\frac{9}{5}\\9\div5=\frac{9}{5}=1\frac{4}{5}=1.8\\$ So the answer is 1.8$.

We can also represent ratios by using fraction notation, thus $2:5=\frac{2}{5}$

### Ratio tables

A ratio table gives a bunch of equivalent ratios.

Example:

Ben drinks 1 glass of milk for every 2 cookies he eats:

| milk | cookies |
| ---- | ------- |
| 1    | 2       |

We can expand further:

| milk | cookies |
| ---- | ------- |
| 1    | 2       |
| 2    | 4       |

Notice that both ratios in the ratio table are equivalent: $\frac{1}{2}=\frac{2}{4}$

| milk | cookies |
| ---- | ------- |
| 1    | 2       |
| 2    | 4       |
| 3    | 6       |
| 4    | 8       |
| ...  | ...     |

$\frac{1}{2}=\frac{2}{4},\frac{2}{3}=\frac{4}{6}, \frac{3}{4}=\frac{6}{8}$

### Rate

A rate is a special ratio in which the two terms are in different units, like cents and grams. Rates are used by people every day, such as when they work 40 hours a week or earn interest every year at a bank. A **unit rate** is a rate with a denominator of 1.

If we have a multiple-unit rate such as 120 students for every 3 buses, and want to find the single-unit rate, we can write a ratio equal to the multiple-unit rate with 1 as the second term.

$$
120/3 = 40/1
$$

The unit rate of 120 students for every 3 buses is 40 students per bus. You could also find the unit rate by dividing the first term of the ratio by the second term.

When prices are expressed as a quantity of 1, such as $25 per ticket or $0.89 per can, they are called **unit prices**. If we have a multiple-unit price, such as \$5.50 for 5 pounds of potatoes, and want to find the single-unit price, divide the multiple-unit price by the number of units.

$$
$5.50 รท 5 = $1.10
$$

The unit price of potatoes that cost $5.50 for 5 pounds is $1.10 per pound.

> Rates and unit rates are used to solve many real-world problems. Also a lot of theory in Algebra nad Calculus depends on rates, which is why it's important to learn how they work.

_Some examples:_

-   At the market, 8 batteries cost 10\$. How much do 6 batteries cost?
    -   $8:10=(8/8):(10/8)=1:\frac{10}{8}=1:\frac{5}{4}=1:1\frac{1}{4}=1:1.25\\6 \times 1.25=7.50$

## Percent

> The word _percent_ comes from the latin word _Per Centum_ which means hundred. So, percent can be literally translated to **per hundred**. 20% -> 20 per 100 = 20:100 So 75% really means $\frac{75}{100}$. 100% is $\frac{100}{100}$ , or exactly 1 (100% of any number is just the number, unchanged). 200% is $\frac{200}{100}$ , or exactly 2 (200% of any number is twice the number).

_Some examples:_

-   100% of 80 is $\frac{100}{100} \times 80=80$
-   50% of 80 is $\frac{50}{100}\times80=40$
-   5% of 80 is $\frac{5}{100}\times80=4$

> A Percent can also be expressed as a Decimal or a Fraction; a half can be written as a percentage: 50%, as a decimal: 0.5 and as a fraction $\frac{1}{2}$.

**This little rule can make some calculations easier:**

$$
x\% \text{ of } y = y\% \text{ of } x
$$

Take for example 8% of 50:

-   8% of 50 is the same as 50% of 8

-   And 50% of 8 is 4

-   So 8% of 50 is also 4

### Converting percents to decimals & fractions

Percents, fractions, and decimals are all just different ways of writing numbers. For example, each of the following are equivalent: 50%, $\frac{1}{2}$, 0.5.

When converting fractions to percents, the key step is to rewrite fraction to denominator of 100.

To write a percent as a decimal, we divide the percent by 100, and vice versa, when writing a decimal as a percent, we multiply the decimal by 100.

_Some examples:_

-   Rewrite 18% as a decimal and as a fraction in simplest form:
    -   18% = 18 per 100 = $\frac{18}{100} = 0.18 = \frac{9}{50}$
    -   A faster way to derive a decimal from the percent would be to divide 18 by 100 by moving all the digits to the right two times, which equals .18.
-   Rewrite 0.601 to percent:
    -   $\frac{0.601}{1} \times \frac{100}{100}= \frac{60.1}{100}= 60.1\%$
-   Rewrite 1.501 as a percentage:
    -   $\frac{1.501}{1}\times \frac{100}{100}=\frac{150.1}{100}=150.1\%$
-   Convert 59.2% to a decimal:
    -   $\frac{59.2}{100}=0.592$
-   Convert 113.9% to a decimal:
    -   $\frac{113.9}{100}=1.139$
-   What percent of 16 is 4?
    -   $\frac{4}{16}=\frac{1}{4}=\frac{25}{100}=25\%$
-   What 30% of 6 is?
    -   $\frac{30}{100}\times\frac{6}{1}=\frac{18\cancel{0}}{10\cancel{0}}=\frac{18}{10}=\frac{9}{5}=1\frac{4}{5}=1.8$
-   100 is what percent of 80?
    -   $80 \times x=100 \\ x=\frac{100}{80}=\frac{25}{20}=\frac{5}{4}=1\frac{1}{4}=1.25=1.25 \times 100 = 125\%$
-   150 is 25% of what number?
    -   $25\% \cdot x= 0.25x=150 \\\frac{0.25x}{0.25}=\frac{150}{0.25}=600$
    -   Identify the percent, amount and base in this problem:
        -   $amount = percent \times base$
        -   $150=25\% \times 600$
-   350 is 70% of a whole number. What number is that?
    -   $70\% \times x = 350\\0.7x=350\\\frac{0.7x}{0.7}=\frac{350}{0.7}=500$
    -   Dividing whole numbers by decimals can be simplified by converting the decimal to a whole number (multiplying it by 10, 100, ...), just keep in mind that we need to multiply the numerator by the same amount. Thus: $\frac{3500}{7}$.
