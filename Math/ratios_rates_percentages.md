# Ratios, rates, & percentages

## Ratio

> The numbers or measurements being compared are called the terms of the ratio.

The ratio is the relationship of two numbers. For example you have 2 flashlights and 5 batteries. To compare the ratio between the flashlights and the batteries we divide the set of flashlights with the set of batteries.

The ratio is 2 to 5 or 2:5 or 2/5. All these describe the ratio in different forms of fractions. The ratio can consequently be expressed as fractions or as a decimal. 2:5 in decimals is 0.4.

_Some Examples:_

-   Thea has 6 pieces of granite, 21 pieces of marble, 12 pieces of sandstone, and 11 piece of slate. _What is the ratio of pieces of sandstone to pieces of marble in Thea's collection?_ Answer: **12:21**

We can simplify the answer further, as both numbers are divisible by 3, thus simplified answer would be **4:7**, or ,in words, four for every seven.

-   If 5 kgs of avocados cost 9 dollars, what is the cost for 1 kg of avocados? - So, the ratio here is $5:9$, and to calculate how much one kg costs we can simplify this: $\\5:9=1:\frac{9}{5}\\9\div5=\frac{9}{5}=1\frac{4}{5}=1.8\\$ So the answer is 1.8$.

We can also represent ratios by using fraction notation, thus $2:5=\frac{2}{5}$

### Ratio tables

A ratio table gives a bunch of equivalent ratios.

Example:

Ben drinks 1 glass of milk for every 2 cookies he eats:

| milk | cookies |
| ---- | ------- |
| 1    | 2       |

We can expand further:

| milk | cookies |
| ---- | ------- |
| 1    | 2       |
| 2    | 4       |

Notice that both ratios in the ratio table are equivalent: $\frac{1}{2}=\frac{2}{4}$

| milk | cookies |
| ---- | ------- |
| 1    | 2       |
| 2    | 4       |
| 3    | 6       |
| 4    | 8       |
| ...  | ...     |

$\frac{1}{2}=\frac{2}{4},\frac{2}{3}=\frac{4}{6}, \frac{3}{4}=\frac{6}{8}$

### Rate

A rate is a special ratio in which the two terms are in different units, like cents and grams. Rates are used by people every day, such as when they work 40 hours a week or earn interest every year at a bank. A **unit rate** is a rate with a denominator of 1.

If we have a multiple-unit rate such as 120 students for every 3 buses, and want to find the single-unit rate, we can write a ratio equal to the multiple-unit rate with 1 as the second term.

$$
120/3 = 40/1
$$

The unit rate of 120 students for every 3 buses is 40 students per bus. You could also find the unit rate by dividing the first term of the ratio by the second term.

When prices are expressed as a quantity of 1, such as $25 per ticket or $0.89 per can, they are called **unit prices**. If we have a multiple-unit price, such as \$5.50 for 5 pounds of potatoes, and want to find the single-unit price, divide the multiple-unit price by the number of units.

$$
$5.50 รท 5 = $1.10
$$

The unit price of potatoes that cost $5.50 for 5 pounds is $1.10 per pound.

> Rates and unit rates are used to solve many real-world problems. Also a lot of theory in Algebra nad Calculus depends on rates, which is why it's important to learn how they work.

_Some examples:_

-   At the market, 8 batteries cost 10\$. How much do 6 batteries cost?
    -   $8:10=(8/8):(10/8)=1:\frac{10}{8}=1:\frac{5}{4}=1:1\frac{1}{4}=1:1.25\\6 \times 1.25=7.50$
