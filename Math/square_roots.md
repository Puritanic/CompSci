# Square roots

A square root of a number is a value that can be multiplied by itself to give the original number. A square root of 9 is 3 because when 3 is multiplied by itself we get 9.

It is like asking: **What can we multiply by itself to get this?**

`√` - This is the special symbol that means "square root", it is sort of like a tick,
and actually started hundreds of years ago as a dot with a flick upwards. It is called the **radical**.

## Perfect Squares

The Perfect Squares (also called "Square Numbers") are the squares of the integers:

| int | perfect square |
| --- | -------------- |
| 0   | 0              |
| 1   | 1              |
| 2   | 4              |
| 3   | 9              |
| 4   | 16             |
| 5   | 25             |
| 6   | 36             |
| 7   | 49             |
| 8   | 64             |
| 9   | 81             |
| 10  | 100            |
| 11  | 121            |
| 12  | 144            |
| 13  | 169            |
| 14  | 196            |
| 15  | 225            |

## Calculating Square Roots

It's kinda easy to work out the square root of a perfect square, but it is really hard to work out other square roots.

Example: what is √10?

Well, 3 × 3 = 9 and 4 × 4 = 16, so we can guess the answer is between 3 and 4.
At this point, I get out my calculator and it says: `3.1622776601683793319988935444327`

But the digits just go on and on, without any pattern.
So even the calculator's answer **is only an approximation** !
Numbers like this are called Irrational Numbers

## Principal square root

For example, √9 = 3
but (-3)^2 = 9 too!

Because of this, we can differentiate between the positive and negative sqare root values. When someone asks to find a Principal (positive) square root (√3) that means that he/she wants a positive number. If someone wants a negative square root that would be written as this: (-√3).

`- √9 = - 3`

$$
5 \sqrt{117} = 5 \times \sqrt{(3 \times 3 \times 13)} = 5\sqrt{3 \times 3} \sqrt{13} = 5\sqrt{9} \sqrt{13} = 15\sqrt{13}
$$

because 13 x 9 = 117, we then simplify 9 to 3 x 3 = 9, and sqrt(9) = 3; 5 x 3 = 15 x
sqrt(13). We cannot factor it out as it's prime number.

26 don't have any perfect squares in it too, so we can leave it like this:

$$
3 \sqrt{26} = 3 \sqrt{26}
$$
