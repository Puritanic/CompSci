Here are five Big O run times that youâ€™ll encounter a lot, sorted from fastest to slowest:

-   O(log n), also known as log time. Example: Binary search.
-   O(n), also known as linear time. Example: Simple search.
-   O(n \* log n). Example: A fast sorting algorithm, like quicksort (coming up in chapter 4).
-   O(n2). Example: A slow sorting algorithm, like selection sort (coming up in chapter 2).
-   O(n!). Example: A really slow algorithm, like the traveling salesperson (coming up next!).
